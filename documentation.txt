DART: The libraries - the common ones
1. dart:core - built in types, collections and other core functionality for every dart programming
2. dart:collection - for collection types e.g queues, linked lists, hashmaps and binary trees. 
3. dart:convert - encoders and decorders for converting between diff. data rep. including json and utf-8
4. dart:math - mathematical constants and functions and random number generations
5. dart:io - file,socket,http and other i/o support for non-web applications


// DART TOUR
1. Everything being placed in a variable is an OBJECT,and every object is an instance of a CLASS. 
2. CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION :  ' express condition ? expr1: expr2 ' 
3. VARIABLES : var name = 'bob'; ( variable store references)
4. LATE VARIABLES: late modifier , having two use cases - * declaring a non nullable variable that's initialized after its' declaration. * lazily initializing a variable. 
    DISCLAIMER: if a variable is set before it's used but dart disagrees, it can be fixed by marking the variable as LATE. 
5. FINAL AND CONST : using final and const when never intending to change a variable. A final can be set only once, a const is a compile time constant - const variables are implicitly final. 
6. BUILT IN TYPES : 
    1. Numbers (int, double)
    2. Strings(String)
    3. Booleans(bool)
    4. Lists(List, also known as arrays)
    5. Sets(Set)
    6. Maps(Map)
    7. Symbols(Symbol)
    8. Runes(Runes - often replaced by the characters API)
